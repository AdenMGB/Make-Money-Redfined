Make Money Redefined is a remake of the Chrome Extention 'Make Money' (made by EconomicalStudios) currently being made by 2 contributors, AdenMGB and Sortedsheep9448.

The main purpose for this project is to revamp the UI of make money by making a dupicate and just making it feel more lively and fun.
We are making this because school kids need more fun during school-time whilst also being sneaky as it doesn't leave URL history.
